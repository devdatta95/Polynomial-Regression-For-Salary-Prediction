# Polynomial-Regression-For-Salary-Prediction
 A simple R program that implements a very basic Polynomial Regression on a small data set. Because these data set don't have  liner relationship between independent variable and dependent variable. so if we use the liner model then well get very High  error. so in these example w'll compare both the model and select which one is best.
